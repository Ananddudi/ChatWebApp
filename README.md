I have built the application using javascript framework or library <b><i>React</i></b> as frontend and python framework <b><i>Django</i></b> as backend as well as <b><i>Django-Rest-Framework</i></b> for api because it deals with flawless <i>authentication</i> and <i>serialization</i> of data which supports <b>ORM / non-ORM</b>. I also prefer functional based approach for frontend as well as backend because it allows rooms for customization and facile finding bug<br/>
<br>
Used <b>Figma</b> for creating svg file which shows at beginning while loading data. To decode the access token i incorporate jwt-decode dependency which in return providing customized data in the token.

Implemented two approaches for modeling the database that can store,modify and retrive data differently. <i>well it is somewhat inefficient for a chat app to have default database rather <b><i>WebSocket</i></b> would be prime addressing the issue.</i>

I could also use useReducer for state management rather than useState but it was my first this big web application so i didn't want to more complicated it.  

The extra functionality which i added here is random chats. Mean by that You can chat with 
anyone who is registered themselves to the app just by submitting their names but if you want to register 
yourself to the app by your <em>credentials</em> you will get list of all registered users with star tag on your profile
as well.<br><b><i>here is one important privilege must also be consider which is if you don't register yourself as authenticated user
and do other approach as random user then all your chat even your chat room will be deleted after 24 hours(a day)</i></b> :blush:

<h3>One more thing i want to say that there is no copy paste of a single line of code in whole project all things are written by me</h3>
