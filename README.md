# This is a chat App <br>
The aim of this app was just for portfolio, not for random use and that is why i didn't use
websockets for managing the communication between the client & the server.I did also implement
two approach for building database models for chats :neckbeard:<br>
The extra functionality which i added here is random chats. Mean by that You can chat with 
anyone who is registered themselves to the app just by submitting their names but if you want register by
your ***credentials*** you will get all registered users with star tag on your profile as well :blush:
