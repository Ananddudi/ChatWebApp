# This is a chat App <br>
The aim of this app was just for portfolio, not for random use and that is why i didn't use
websockets for managing the communication between the client & the server.I did also implement
two approach for building database models for chats :neckbeard:<br>
The extra functionality which i added here is random chats. Mean by that You can chat with 
anyone who is registered themselves to the app just by submitting their names but if you want to register 
yourself to the app by your ***credentials*** you will get list of all registered users with star tag on your profile
as well.<br>**here is one important privilege must also be consider which is if you don't register yourself as authenticated user
and do other approach as random user then all your chat even your chat room will be deleted after 24 hours(a day)** :blush:
