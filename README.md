# This is a chat App <br>
<p>
    The aim of this app was just for portfolio ,not for random use and that is why i didn't used
    websockets for anaging the communication between the client & the server. :neckbeard:</p>
The extra functionality which i added here is random chats. Mean by that is how You can chat with 
anyone who is registered themself to the app just by submitting their names.if you want register by
your **credentials** you will get all registered users with star tag on your profile as well :blush:
